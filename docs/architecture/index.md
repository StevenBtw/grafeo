# Architecture

Understand how Grafeo is designed and implemented.

## Overview

Grafeo is built as a modular system with clear separation of concerns:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "User Interface"
        PY[Python API]
        RS[Rust API]
    end

    subgraph "grafeo-engine"
        DB[Database]
        SESS[Session Manager]
        QP[Query Processor]
        TXN[Transaction Manager]
    end

    subgraph "grafeo-adapters"
        GQL[GQL Parser]
        WAL[WAL Storage]
        PLUG[Plugins]
    end

    subgraph "grafeo-core"
        LPG[LPG Store]
        IDX[Indexes]
        EXEC[Execution Engine]
    end

    subgraph "grafeo-common"
        TYPES[Types]
        MEM[Memory]
        UTIL[Utilities]
    end

    PY --> DB
    RS --> DB
    DB --> SESS
    SESS --> QP
    SESS --> TXN
    QP --> GQL
    QP --> EXEC
    TXN --> LPG
    EXEC --> LPG
    EXEC --> IDX
    LPG --> TYPES
    IDX --> MEM
```

## Design Principles

1. **Performance First** - Optimized for graph workloads
2. **Embeddable** - Zero external dependencies
3. **Safe** - Written in safe Rust
4. **Modular** - Clear crate boundaries
5. **Extensible** - Plugin architecture
