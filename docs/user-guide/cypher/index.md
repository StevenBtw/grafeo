# Cypher Query Language

Cypher is a declarative graph query language originally developed by Neo4j. Grafeo fully supports Cypher alongside GQL.

## Overview

Cypher uses ASCII-art style pattern matching to query and manipulate graph data. It's designed to be intuitive and readable.

## Quick Reference

| Operation | Syntax |
|-----------|--------|
| Match nodes | `MATCH (n:Label)` |
| Match edges | `MATCH (a)-[:TYPE]->(b)` |
| Filter | `WHERE n.property > value` |
| Return | `RETURN n.property` |
| Create | `CREATE (:Label {prop: value})` |
| Update | `SET n.property = value` |
| Delete | `DELETE n` |
